## The Fruit Mart: A CRUD Operation Project in React 
- This React project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for a fruit market simulation. Let's explore its functionalities(it only UI design and some basic crud opretaion):
### Buying Fruit:

- Selecting a Fruit: Click the "Buy" button next to the desired fruit.
- Quantity Input and Error Handling:
1. Fruit Selected: Enter a quantity to purchase. If successful, an alert will confirm the order and update the fruit's available quantity accordingly.
2. No Fruit Selected: If you try to buy fruit without selecting one first, an alert message will appear, prompting you to "Please choose a particular fruit" before entering a quantity.
3. Out of Stock: If you attempt to buy the entire remaining stock of a particular fruit,after buying that fruit "BUY" button  will become disabled, indicating that the item is out of stock.

### Adding Products:

- A dedicated "Add" section allows you to introduce new fruits or modify existing ones:

1. New Fruit: Provide details like name, quantity, and price to add a completely new fruit item.
2. Existing Fruit: To add more stock to an existing fruit, simply enter its name, quantity (the amount you're adding), and price. This will update the quantity displayed for that fruit.<br>
